Grid Overlay Vanilla.js Plugin
==========================

A Vanilla.js plugin for creating a grid overlay on your site. Allows you to easily align design elements to your grid.

Please Note
-----------

This is untested in older browsers and in IE-anything. This isn't really OK, because although it's for development purposes, it would be nice to confirm layout pixel-perfection during cross-browser testing. 

I smell a sequel!
